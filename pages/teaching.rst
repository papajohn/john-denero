Materials
---------

`Composing Programs <http://composingprograms.com>`_ is a free online textbook
on programming paradigms and introductory computer science concepts, based on
the seminal `Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
<http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/>`_ (SICP) textbook by Abelson and Sussman.

A suite of `introductory programming projects
<http://composingprograms.com/projects.html>`_ accompanies the Composing
Programs textbook.  These are freely available to use in other courses.

The `Pac-Man Projects
<http://rll.berkeley.edu/cs188/html/navigation.html?page=overview>`_ for
teaching artificial intelligence were revised in 2013 to include new testing
scripts that students can run themselves.

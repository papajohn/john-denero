Materials
---------

`Composing Programs <http://composingprograms.com>`_ is a free online textbook
on programming paradigms and introductory computer science concepts, based on
the seminal `Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
<http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/>`_ (SICP) textbook by Abelson and Sussman.

A suite of `introductory programming projects
<http://composingprograms.com/projects.html>`_ accompanies the Composing
Programs textbook.  These are freely available to use in other courses.

`Computational and Inferential Thinking <http://inferentialthinking.com>`_: The
Foundations of Data Science is a free online textbook that provides an
introduction to programming and statistics using real-world examples.

The `Pac-Man Projects
<http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html>`_ for
teaching artificial intelligence were revised in 2013 to include new testing
scripts that students can run themselves.
